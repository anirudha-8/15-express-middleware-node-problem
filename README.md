# 🌟 Problem 15: Logging Requests with Express Middleware 🌟  

Welcome to the fifteenth challenge in the Node.js problem series! 🚀 In this challenge, you’ll learn how to create a custom Express middleware that logs the **HTTP method** and **URL** of every incoming request. Mastering middleware is a crucial step toward building robust web applications! 💻  

---

## 📝 Problem Statement  

Create an **Express.js middleware** that logs the **request method** and **URL** for each incoming request to the server.  

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals  

- Understand the concept and purpose of middleware in Express.js.  
- Learn how to create and use custom middleware in an Express application.  
- Practice logging and monitoring requests for better debugging and insights.  

---

## 📂 Project Structure  

Your project folder should look like this:  

```bash  
15-express-middleware-node-problem/  
├── server.js              # Express server script with middleware  
├── README.md              # Documentation for this problem  
└── package.json           # Project configuration file  
```

---

## 🌟 Features to Enhance

Once you've implemented the basic functionality, try adding:

- **Timestamp Logging**: Include the time of each request.

- **Response Status Code**: Log the response status code in addition to the method and URL.

- **Log File**: Write logs to a file instead of displaying them in the console.

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn

- The role of middleware in the Express.js request-response cycle.

- How to create reusable middleware functions.

- Techniques for logging and debugging Express applications.
